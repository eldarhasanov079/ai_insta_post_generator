# Instagram ArtBot: DALLE + ChatGPT


## Introduction

Instagram ArtBot is an exciting program that combines the power of DALLE for image generation and ChatGPT for post descriptions to create captivating daily Instagram posts automatically. The program generates stunning paintings of Baku, Azerbaijan, as if they were drawn by different famous artists throughout history. Each day, the bot uploads a unique piece of art with an engaging description to your Instagram account, providing your followers with a delightful artistic experience.

## How It Works

The Instagram ArtBot utilizes two cutting-edge AI models: DALL-E and ChatGPT, both of which have been pretrained on vast datasets to understand images and text, respectively.

1. **DALL-E Image Generation**: DALL-E, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful generative model capable of creating high-quality images based on textual prompts. The bot takes a textual prompt describing the desired painting style, such as "Van Gogh's Starry Night inspired painting of Baku's cityscape," and generates an impressive artwork accordingly.

2. **ChatGPT Post Descriptions**: ChatGPT, another creation by OpenAI, is a language model capable of generating human-like text. After the image is generated, ChatGPT takes over to compose an engaging post description to accompany the artwork. The description could be a historical background on the art style, a fictional story about the depicted scene, or any creative narrative to captivate your audience.

3. **Automatic Instagram Upload**: Once the image and post description are ready, the Instagram ArtBot automatically uploads them to your Instagram account at a pre-scheduled time every day. This ensures a steady stream of artistic content without any manual intervention.

## Requirements

Before running the Instagram ArtBot, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x

- Necessary Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

## Setup and Configuration

```

2. Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash

```

3. Obtain API keys and access tokens for DALL-E and ChatGPT from their respective platforms. Place these keys in the configuration file (`config.py`).

4. Configure your Instagram Business Account with the appropriate credentials in `config.py`. Make sure you enable automatic posting or provide the necessary permissions for the bot to upload posts.

## Usage

## Variations
